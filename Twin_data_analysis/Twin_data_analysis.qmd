## Twin data

- Twin data are dyadic data (Non-independence)
- Twins are more similar than a random person in the data set.
- Twins models can separate variance into genetic and environmental sources.


## Dyadic Data Analsyis: SEM approach {background-color="#D4D925"}

## Variance Components

- Poposed orignailly by [Shaun Purcell](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Purcell+S&cauthor_id=12573187)

  * Additive variation in genotype (A)
  * Shared environment (C)
  * Nonshared environment (E)

- Moderation: 

::: r-fit-text

> "The parameters of interest (e.g., a2, c2, and e2) are estimated for "exposed" and "unexposed" individuals separately." 

> "A test of G × E is given by equating the parameters across exposure groups and observing the associated decline in model fit."

> "Our investigation supports our hypothesis that the magnitude of genetic influences on cognitive aptitude varies with socioeconomic status. ... Our results suggest that differences between middle-class and affluent parents affect the expression of genetic potential."

> The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost
exactly the reverse.

## Harden, et al.  

- They wanted to study the genes-environment interaction 
- They changed the SES measure to parents' income and education
- They have two different types of twin 
	- MZ monozygotic.
	- DZ dizygotic.
- They estimated the following model.  

## Genes Enviroment Interaction (GxE) {background-color="#D4D925"}

## The model

> ACE are latent variables with mean = 0, SD = 1, and the squared path coefficient from the A component to the phenotype == the heritability. The GxE model estimates that path coefficient as the function of the measured environmental variable (ENV): a + a' X env, such that a2 is the heritability when ENV ==0 (if it has been standardized to M = 0, SD = 1, then at the mean of the environmental variable) and a' is the interaction parameter.

## Potential application

- Analysis of dyadic data.

|   | Parent    | Student   | n    |
|---|-----------|-----------|:----:|
| 1 | Female    | Female    | 114  |   
| 2 | Female    | Male      | 55   |   
| 3 | Male      | Female    | 16   |   
| 4 | Male      | Male      | 9    |   

## Potential application

Sex differences in perception of risk?
